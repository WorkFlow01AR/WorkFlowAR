{[DiSCLAiMER]; I don't know ANYTHING ABOUT CODING STRUCTURE at all. Syntax, might as well be alian calculous
That being said, I've created this page because I have a goal, to create my own APP. The purpose of the app\
is something that is already currently being done, but I feel that I could build an app and have the same functionality\
without haveing to grant external access to my banking account. Apps like "Trim" that tracks your spending\
and shows you your recurring charges, and offters to stop the recurring charges. I love the idea of it, right up until
they say "Enter your full (Routing, Account) numbers. Just can't trust it lol. 

I hear Python is good for app automation... Lets see what I can do.
